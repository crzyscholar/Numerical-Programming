1.Methods Chosen:
The two methods used in the code are Nearest Neighbor and Bicubic Interpolation.
Nearest Neighbor works by simply copying the value of the nearest pixel. This method is fast but 
produces blocky or pixelated images, especially when resizing significantly.
Bicubic Interpolation takes into account the values of 16 neighboring pixels (4x4 grid) to compute a 
new pixel value. It creates smoother images and preserves more details, especially for larger resizing.

2.Chosen Image for Good Results:
I selected an image named "text.jpg" for the experiment. Bicubic interpolation works well for this image 
because it preserves the fine details and doesn't introduce too much pixelation when zooming or resizing.

3.Chosen Image for Poor Results:
A poor result might occur when using these methods on images with very sharp edges or a lot of noise. 
In these cases, methods like Nearest Neighbor can create noticeable artifacts or blockiness, and Bicubic may soften the edges too much.

4.Matrix Norms for Error Estimation:
I used the Frobenius norm to estimate the error between the original image and the resized images. 
The Frobenius norm calculates the difference between the pixel values of two images, which gives a 
sense of how much the resized image deviates from the original one. A higher error value means a worse result.
The code calculates errors for both Nearest Neighbor and Bicubic interpolations, and prints out the results to compare them.

5.Numerical Experiments and Conclusions:
When the image is zoomed multiple times using Nearest Neighbor, the result becomes more pixelated and blocky, 
especially in areas with sharp edges or smooth gradients.
Bicubic interpolation performs better in these cases, as it smoothens out the transition between 
pixels and preserves more details, resulting in a clearer image when zoomed.
However, Bicubic may not always work well for all types of images. It can blur sharp edges, 
especially in images with high contrast or fine details, making it unsuitable for certain cases where clarity is crucial.

In summary, Bicubic interpolation generally produces better results for images with smooth gradients and fine details, while Nearest 
Neighbor is faster but can result in blocky images, especially when resizing significantly. The Frobenius norm helps quantify these differences 
by measuring the pixel-wise error between the resized image and the original.
