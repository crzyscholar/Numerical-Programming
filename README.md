# This is a repository containing all the exercises and methods I have done for Numerical Programming mainly using python

### AP1
AP1 is a model which implements clustering using k-means clustering and k-medoids clustering. I clustered different types of malware based on their degree 
of use of different types of APIs. I generated the data synthetically. all the details can be seen in the [report](https://github.com/crzyscholar/Numerical-Programming/blob/main/AP1/clustering_report.pdf).

### AP2
This assignment is about showing inaccurate calculations by computer due to finite precision arithmetics. for developing test cases I explored round of
errors, underflow, overflow, violation of associative property etc.. 
I also visualized errors using tangent lines in one and two spacial dimensions.

### AP3
In this assignment I resized an image using interpolation algorithms. Two methods I used are Nearest Neighbor Algorithm and Bicubic Interpolation. I have 
images which produce good results and bad results with the algorithms I chose to use. to estimate the error between original image and the resized one I used Frobenius norm.
The details of implementation and explanation of the algorithms and methods used can be seen in the [report](https://github.com/crzyscholar/Numerical-Programming/blob/main/AP3/explanation.txt).

### AP4
This is just a puzzle generator using curves. it just slaps on the curves on the inputted image. The detailed explanation can be seen in the according [documentation](https://github.com/crzyscholar/Numerical-Programming/blob/main/AP4/explanation.txt).

### AP5
Solved a system of Ordinary Differential Equations(ODEs) using numerical methods. I chose the predator prey model. This is documented pretty well in the corresponding 
[explanation file](https://github.com/crzyscholar/Numerical-Programming/blob/main/AP5/explanation.md).
### AP6
System of nonlinear ODEs.

### AP7
everything is documented in [explanation](https://github.com/crzyscholar/Numerical-Programming/blob/main/AP7/explanation.md).

### ComputationalProject1
I extracted number of moving objects and conventional motion speed from a video. I used edgre detection and clustering methods alongside of thresholding and smoothing technics. [Detailed explanation](https://github.com/crzyscholar/Numerical-Programming/blob/main/ComputationalProject1/final/algo.txt)

### ComputationalProject2
I determined the velocity, mass and drag coefficient of a ball by analyzing its motion in a video from point A to point B. I used ball motion ODEs and numerical methods. [Detailed explanation](https://github.com/crzyscholar/Numerical-Programming/blob/main/ComputationalProject2/explanation.md)

### finalProject
This consists of two exercises. 
1. hit a ball to a fixed target
2. intercept a moving ball
Both of the exercises are equipped with explanations and examples, as well as test images.([first task](https://github.com/crzyscholar/Numerical-Programming/blob/main/finalProject/first_task/first%20task.md) and [second task](https://github.com/crzyscholar/Numerical-Programming/blob/main/finalProject/second_task/Second%20Task.md)).


Everything else is just a small exrcise I did along the way.
